						<p>Welcome to Baby Dayr!</p>

						<br>

						<p>
						This program is aimed at helping moms feed their babies in a healthy, positive way, through daily activities that we are calling challenges. Over time, completing these challenges can enable moms to be more knowledgeable about baby's nutritional needs, helping them with raising a healthier and happier baby.
