Challenge.create({:name => "Count the Cues, not the Minutes", :description => "*Why it's important:*
 * Cues are signs that your baby uses to tell you something! 
 * Your baby's cues will tell you when they are full!
 * Cues often come in groups. For example, a baby could cry, turn away, and arch their back all at the same time.
 * Hint: Let your baby decide whether or not to eat, and how much to eat.  Don't force your baby to feed for a specific amount of time. 
 
 *How to?*
 * Hide the clock while feeding your baby today (yes, that includes the cell phone!). 
 * Instead, keep track of your baby's ""stop"" and ""go"" cues
 * When you see a group of ""stop"" cues take a break from feeding your baby.
 * Don't forget to log on and officially complete the challenge by clicking on the ""challenge completed"" button!  
 
 *Supplemental material/extra:*
 * Table of ""stop"" and ""go"" cues - you can print a copy to keep!
 * Twitter Tip: As your baby grows up remember that how much or how long your baby eats should be up to him or her. 
 * Research shows that healthy babies will not starve themselves.  When provided with healthy options they will naturally select what their bodies need.

Challenge.create({:name => "Make your baby the star of your attention", :description => "*Why it's important:* 
 * TV in the background or loud music will take your baby's attention away from feeding.
 * The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests no TV time for kids less than two years of age. Why? Research shows babies need face-to-face interaction to have healthy brain growth and development. 
 * Your baby needs YOU more than anything else!
 
 *How to?*
 * Turn the TV off before your start the feeding. 
 * Put your phone on silent!  If you think you'll be tempted to use it, leave in it in another room!
 * Try singing or humming to your baby.  Talk to your little one too!

 <br>
 <p> *MYTH*: ""If I'm not happy, I'm not normal...maybe even a bad mom.""
 *TRUTH*: 70-80% of new moms report having some form of baby blues </p>
 
 <br>
 
 *Why it's important:* 
 * 70-80% of new moms experience some degree of ""baby blues""
 ** 15% of them end up experiencing full blown post-partum depression 
 ** Often symptoms begin 4-5 days after the birth of your baby
 ** Symptoms usually begin to get better after about two weeks
 ** If symptoms continue past two weeks, it is considered post-partum depression
 * This IS NOT your fault! Baby blues and postpartum depression are caused by a drop in hormone levels after giving birth
 * Believe it or not, new dads can experience baby blues as well 
 
 <br>
 
 *What should I do?*
 * Understand that some levels of depression are normal after giving birth
 ** Your body is adjusting to changes and you are adapting a new lifestyle
 * Talk to your doctor if:
 ** Symptoms don't fade after two weeks or last more than a couple hours a day
 ** Symptoms are getting worse
 ** Symptoms make it hard to care for your baby
 ** You begin to have thoughts of harming yourself or your baby
 ** ALL can be signs of post-partum depression, and not just baby blues
 * Find an activity you enjoy that can help relieve stress 
 ** Examples: reading, yoga, art, exercises, listening to music, watching a movie etc.
 ** Turning to drinking, smoking, or drugs can seem stress relieving, but can cause lots of harm to you and your baby in the long run 
 * *When in doubt, discuss any concerns with your doctor!!!*" })
